## Course Objective and Learning Outcomes 
### Course Objectives
This course explores in greater depth the analysis and design of computer algorithms. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to do the following:
* Analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms.  
* Demonstrate a familiarity with advanced algorithms.  
* Apply important advanced algorithmic design paradigms and methods of analysis.  
* Synthesize efficient algorithms in common program design situations.  

### Student Learning Outcomes
Students who complete the course will have demonstrated the ability to do the following:
* Analyze worst-case running times of algorithms using asymptotic analysis. Compare the asymptotic behaviors of functions obtained by elementary composition of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithmic functions.
* Describe the brute-force paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize brute-force algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe the divide-and-conquer paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize
divide-and-conquer algorithms. Derive and solve recurrences describing the performance of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
* Describe the dynamic-programming paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize dynamic-programming algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe the greedy paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize greedy algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe how to represent a graph in a computer and discuss algorithms based on searching a graph. Describe how to compute a minimum-weight spanning tree
of a graph. Consider how to compute shortest paths between vertices when each edge has an associated length. Show how to compute a maximum flow of material in a flow network
* Describe the difference between three classes of NP-complete problems: P, NP, and NPC. Establish a problem as NP-complete, and provide good evidence for its intractability. Recite how to use a polynomial-time reduction algorithm to solve a decision problem in polynomial time, given a polynomial-time decision algorithm for another problem.

## Academic Honesty
The University's goal is to foster an intellectual atmosphere that produces educated,
literate people. Because cheating and plagiarism are at odds with that goal, those
actions shall not be tolerated in any form. If a student engages in academic
dishonesty, the student may be dismissed from the class and may receive a failing
grade. Other penalties may include suspension or expulsion from the University.

## University Attendance Policy
Students are expected to attend classes regularly. Missing one of two first classes
may result in your automatic withdrawal from the class. See the policy at:

## Educational Access Center
Students with temporary or permanent disabilities needing accommodations to fully participate
in this class should contact the Educational Access Center (EAC). All accommodations must
be approved through the EAC prior to being implemented. To learn more about the accommodation
process, visit the EAC’s website http://www.boisestate.edu/eac/
