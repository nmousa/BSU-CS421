## Course Objective and Learning Outcomes 
### Course Objectives
This course explores in greater depth the analysis and design of computer algorithms. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to do the following:
* Analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithms.  
* Demonstrate a familiarity with advanced algorithms.  
* Apply important advanced algorithmic design paradigms and methods of analysis.  
* Synthesize efficient algorithms in common program design situations.  

### Student Learning Outcomes
Students who complete the course will have demonstrated the ability to do the following:
* Analyze worst-case running times of algorithms using asymptotic analysis. Compare the asymptotic behaviors of functions obtained by elementary composition of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithmic functions.
* Describe the brute-force paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize brute-force algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe the divide-and-conquer paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize
divide-and-conquer algorithms. Derive and solve recurrences describing the performance of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
* Describe the dynamic-programming paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize dynamic-programming algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe the greedy paradigm and explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for it. Recite algorithms that employ this paradigm. Synthesize greedy algorithms, and analyze them.
* Describe how to represent a graph in a computer and discuss algorithms based on searching a graph. Describe how to compute a minimum-weight spanning tree
of a graph. Consider how to compute shortest paths between vertices when each edge has an associated length. Show how to compute a maximum flow of material in a flow network
* Describe the difference between three classes of NP-complete problems: P, NP, and NPC. Establish a problem as NP-complete, and provide good evidence for its intractability. Recite how to use a polynomial-time reduction algorithm to solve a decision problem in polynomial time, given a polynomial-time decision algorithm for another problem.
